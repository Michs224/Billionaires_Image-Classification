_**I deployed to AWS, but when I deployed, I used an aws free tier account which now the free tier duration will expire which was originally for 1 year. So, if the link is not working, then you can just run it on your localhost.I deployed to AWS, but when I deployed, I used an aws free tier account which now the free tier duration will expire which was originally for 1 year.
